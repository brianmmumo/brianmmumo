# M Brian
Passionate about blockchain, full-stack development, and building things that actually work on the first try (most of the time).

Currently learning and building on **Avalanche**, Solidity, React, Next.js, and Node.js. Always down to break things and then fix them better than before.

### 🔥 Current Focus
- Avalanche & Subnet development
- Smart contracts (Solidity + Hardhat/Foundry)
- Full-stack dApps
- Low-level systems & networking (when I’m feeling masochistic)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
```text
Solidity • JavaScript / TypeScript • React • Next.js • Node.js • Tailwind • Python • C/C++ • Rust (learning)
Hardhat • Foundry • ethers.js • wagmi • Avalanche • Git • Docker • Linux • NeoVim (yes, I use Arch btw)
